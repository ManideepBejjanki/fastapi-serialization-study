# fastapi-serialization-study

Profile JSON vs. MessagePack response times for an endpoint returning large matrices. 

Submit benchmark scripts that: 

* Expose an endpoint returning a large matrix serialized as JSON
* Expose the same endpoint returning MessagePack
* Tabulate request/response times and payload sizes
* Recommend which format to use in production based on your findings

## Getting Started 

* Setup a Python project.
* Install dependencies: pip install fastapi uvicorn numpy msgpack httpx
* Run benchmark.py file
